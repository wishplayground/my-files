The illustration (examples) paragraph is useful when we want to explain or clarify something, such as an object, a person, a concept, or a situation. When we illustrate, 
we show how something is as we point out. When we illustrate with examples, 
we give instances that show or prove to the readers so they can see for themselves how something is as we claim it to be.


You will notice, then, that illustration paragraphs often answer questions that ask
 what, how, in what wayâ€”questions that need or ask for explanation, examples, cases, and details to illustrate how something is true.
