Task 1.
Statistically Typed Languages are the programming languages that checking type at the compile
time, while Dynamically Typed Languages are the programming languages that checking type at the
run time.
Strongly Typed Languages are the programming languages that consider the type of data strictly
while Loosely Typed Languages are the programming languages that don’t consider the type of data
strictly.
Java is a statistically typed and strongly typed programming language

Task2.
Case sensitive – upper case and lower case letters in identifiers are treated as two different
identifiers.
Example
int variable = 42;
int Variable = 23;
System.out.println(variable);
System.out.println(Variable);
here, no errors and gives values separately.
Java is case sensitive
Case insensitive – it does not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase.
Example treat variable / Variable / VARIABLE as same.
SQL is case insensitive
Case Sensitive-Insensitive – mixed with case insensitive and case sensitive.
Example
treat myVariable and MyVariable as different and treat if and IF as same
JavaScript is Case Sensitive-Insensitive

Task3.
Identity Conversion is a type of type conversion that involves assigning a value to a variable of the
same type, or passing an argument to a method where the argument's type matches the parameter
type exactly.
Example
int number = 42;
int anotherNubmer = number;
long myLong = 151316;
long myNextLong = myLong;
here firstly, a value is assigned to number and that number is assigned to another variable with same
type.

Task4.
Primitive widening conversions are converting a variable with a lesser bits to a variable with a
higher bits. These happen implicitly.
Byte>short>int>long
float>double

Task 5.
run time constant- the value of the constant is known when the project runs
example
final int Const1 = 10*Math.Random();

final int myInt3 = myByte;  // RUN TIME CONSTANT

compile time constant- the value of the constant is known when the project compiles.
Example
final int Const2 =20;

final int myInt4 = 15; //COMPILE TIME CONSTANT


Task6.
Implicit conversions happens automatically and explicit conversions are not happening
automatically without external forcing (casting the target type at the end ).
conditions to met to happen an implicit narrowing primitive conversion

1. an assigning context
2. a compile time constant
3. within the bit range of target type

Task7.
The but structure if the float is different from long. Even the number of bits is lesser, float can store
larger range of values, but with a less accuracy.

Task8.
The choice of using int as the default data type for integer literals and double as the default data
type for floating-point literals in Java is primarily based on balancing practicality, efficiency, and
backward compatibility.

32 bit processor - optimized for 32 bits

64 bit processor - optimized for 32 bits / 64 bits

to maintain consistency between pr. languages selected as follows

int - 32 bits                          long - 64 bits         —>  selected int considering  performance

float - 32 bits                       double - 64 bits     —>  selected long considering  size

considering performance, byte or short was not considered as default data type as the range is smaller.

Task9
because they don’t lose information while narrowing

Task10.
When check in to the chart it have to go through a path of short>int>char which the first step is a
widening primitive conversion and the second step is a narrowing primitive conversion. (but
actually it happens directly as short>char)
